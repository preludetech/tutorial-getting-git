# Installing some software

Before we move onto the practical work, we are going to need to make sure that you have the necessary software installed on your computer. 

You are going to need:

- Git 
- Bash (or similar)

The installation instructions will be different for different operating systems.

## If you are running Linux or WSL

You will already have Bash installed and available.

Open up a terminal and then follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/linux) to install Git. 

## If you are running MacOS 

You will already have Bash or Zsh installed and available. Both of these will work in the same way.

Open up a terminal and follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/mac) to install Git

## If you are running Windows 

Follow the instructions [here](https://git-scm.com/downloads/win) to install Git on Windows.

Once Git is installed, make sure you can launch the Git Bash program.

You can learn more about Git for Windows [here](https://gitforwindows.org/)

## IMPORTANT Git configuration 

Once you have Git installed, open up a terminal and type in the following commands:

Pay close attention: put in your own email address and name, don't use the placeholder values.

```
git config --global user.email "your@email.whatevs"
git config --global user.name "your name"
```
