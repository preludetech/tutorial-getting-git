# Introduction to this workshop 

This workshop is designed to get you comfortable with Git and Github. If you are new to programming then you might have heard of these tools, someone probably told you that they are important, or that they are used for teamwork, or that you need to know Git if you want to be successful in a dev career. All of this is True! 

And there is a good reason for it. Git is a popular tool because it's kinda awesome. It's great for teamwork and solo projects. It's a safety net and a collaboration tool. 

And it's weird and confusing at first for most people. 

This workshop will take you through all the critical Git skills. We will go through the theory you'll need to know, and we'll get our hands dirty with practical exercises. 

## Self-paced 

Everybody who is taking part in this tutorial is different. There are people who are relatively new to programming, and there are people who have been around the block. 

You'll move at different paces and you'll need different things. That is totally fine!

Remember that this is not a race! Take the time you need to understand each step.

Please take the time you need!

## Getting the most out of this tutorial

There is a good chance that you will come across concepts that are not familiar to you as you move through this tutorial. This is expected. Take the time to understand things. 

The more you lean in and try to understand how everything fits together, the more you will get out of this learning experience. 

Don't be afraid to ask questions. Don't feel bad if you are missing a piece of foundational knowledge. Just ask the questions you need to.

Many people in this workshop are very new to coding. Here is some advice that will serve you forever: Get really good at asking questions. Asking questions is a super power! If you get good at getting the help you need then you'll get more help, you'll go further faster.

## Structure 

This workshop aims to give you some robust skills. This is not entertainment. We want you to retain the skills as time continues. That means we will be relying on some tried and true, science-backed teaching mechanisms.

1. Spaced repetition 

If you come across a concept once then you are very likely to forget it. We will revisit concepts a few times in different ways.

2. Realistic exercises

You will be asked to apply what you know in a hands-on way. You'll get to see the theory come to life. This will help you retain information and build strong mental models of the concepts.
