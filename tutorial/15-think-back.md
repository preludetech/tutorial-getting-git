# Think back

At this point you know about how you can use Git for a few different things:

- You can keep track of changes to your code by using commits
- You can use the `checkout` command to view any version of your code 
- You can use branches to develop different features and functionality in a way that is isolated from the `main` branch
- You can `push` code to a remote location to back up and share your work
- You can download code from remote repos using `clone` and `pull` 

Think about this for a moment - it's all pretty powerful stuff. Take a moment to revisit [this part](./01-what-is-git-for.md) of thw workshop. Re-read it. 

Can you see how the functionality we have covered so far solves all the problems we spoke about before? Can you see how branches and remotes help multiple developers collaborate on a code project without standing on each other's toes and messing with each other's work?

Git is an industry-standard tool. It has been adopted by nerds from many walks of life:

- You can use it for small personal projects where you are the only developer involved
- Small companies and startups use Git for all their code 
- Massive organisations like Google, Meta, Tesla and Open AI use Git for all their code 
- Open source projects such as Linux, Django, React, PostgreSQL, and many more rely on Git to allow people to contribute 

I hope that you can see why.

## Advice

For now on, whenever you start a new dev project, start off by making a Git repo. It's always a good first step!

And make a habit of committing and pushing your code to a remote repo. Always do your best to build good habits!

A lot of the time, when a junior developer gets their first job then they struggle to add value even if they know how to code. They just bump their heads on Git for weeks and frustrate their team-mates. It's a big problem!  

You wont have that problem :)
