# Forking a repo 

The next concept worth knowing about is "forking".

Forking is often used in open source projects.  

You can learn all about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks).

And you can learn more about the forking workflow [here](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/comparing-workflows/forking-workflow).

## Challenge: Contribute to someone else's repo by using a fork

In an [earlier section](./16-pull-requests.md) you were given the challenge of making a PR on someone else's repo and getting it merged. This challenge is similar, but now the challenge is to to it using a **fork.**

Here is the challenge:

1. **Fork** someone else's repo 
2. Make a branch on your fork and make some changes. Don't worry too much about doing something fancy. You can make a change to the `README.md` file, add a new page, or make a small change to an existing page.
3. Push your branch 
4. Open a PR, your PR should be aiming to merge your changes onto the repo that you forked. NOT your repo, the other person's repo
5. Get the PR merged 

If someone is trying to make a PR on your repo, then try to set them up for success! Make sure you communicate clearly! 

Here are a few things to explore while you do this:

1. Can you figure out what it means to "Accept" a PR? How about "Request Changes"? And "Close"?
2. Can a developer "Accept" a PR that they created?
3. Can a developer "Accept", or comment on a PR that was created on a repo they don't own?
4. What happens to the PR if more commits are pushed after the PR was created? 
5. How is this different from making a PR on a repo without using a fork?

You should have the `git` command-line skills to try all these things out! 

## Optional Side Quest: Contribute to an Open Source Project!

This is quite a big challenge, but it is something very much worth trying. 

If you are not sure what **Open Source** is, you can learn more about it [here](https://github.com/resources/articles/software-development/what-is-open-source-software).

There are many open source projects on Github. Here are a few fun ones that are fairly easy to contribute to:

- [PursuedPyBear](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear): This is a very simple game engine built in Python. It exists to be an educational resource. Most obviously used to teach computer science, it can be a useful tool for any topic that a simulation can be helpful.
- [This tutorial :) ](https://github.com/preludetech/tutorial-getting-git)

You can also poke around [here](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners?tab=readme-ov-file#python) for a long list of beginner friendly repos.

1. Pick a repo you would like to contribute to, and make a fork of the repo.
2. Make sure you read any `contributing.md` guide and `README.md` on the project you are forking. 
3. You might need to go and look at the repo's [issues](https://docs.github.com/en/issues) in order to see what work needs to be done
4. Make a PR!

**IMPORTANT:** Don't spam people with nonsense PRs. Before submitting a PR for review always review it yourself and make sure that you are doing something that makes the repo better.  Always remember that when you make a PR you are asking a human to review your work. A lot of the people who look after open source Github repos are very busy people and you should always aim to contribute, not waste their time! 

If you can't find a repo you are comfortable making a useful PR on, it's alright! It's something you can aspire to! Keep working on your coding skills and you'll get there!
