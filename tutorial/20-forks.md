# Forking a repo 

The next concept worth knowing about is "forking".

Forking is often used in open source projects.  

You can learn all about forking [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks).

## Optional Side Quest: Contribute to a repo you don't own 

There are many many open source projects on Github. Here are a few fun ones that are fairly easy to contribute to:

- [PursuedPyBear](https://github.com/ppb/pursuedpybear): This is a very simple game engine built in Python. It exists to be an educational resource. Most obviously used to teach computer science, it can be a useful tool for any topic that a simulation can be helpful.
- [This tutorial :) ](https://github.com/preludetech/tutorial-getting-git)

You can also poke around [here](https://github.com/MunGell/awesome-for-beginners?tab=readme-ov-file#python) for a long list of beginner friendly repos.

1. Pick a repo you would like to contribute to, and make a fork of the repo.
2. Make sure you read any `contributing.md` guide and `README.md` on the project you are forking. 
3. You might need to go and look at the repo issues in order to see what work needs to be done
4. Make a PR!

**IMPORTANT:** Don't spam people with nonesense PRs. Before submitting a PR for review always review it yourself and make sure that you are doing something that makes the repo better.  Always remember that when you make a PR you are asking a human to review your work. A lot of the people who look after open source Github repos are very busy people and you should always aim to contribute, not waste their time! 

If you can't find a repo you are comfortable making a useful PR on, then please feel free to use one of mine. Or even a friend's `personal_website` project! In this case, you are welcome to play and experiment :)
