# More Git commands 

We have covered a lot of ground! In this section we are going to touch on a few other commands you will likely come across in your developer journey. We wont go into these in great detail in this workshop. 

Please take some time to read these docs. You should have all the tools you need to understand these:

## Git rebase 

Rebase rewrites history. It is often used instead of `git merge`.

Read [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/rewriting-history/git-rebase) for a good explanation.

## Git stash 

Sometimes you get into a situation where you are not quite ready to commit your code, but you need to switch branches and work on something else. This is where git stash comes in.

Read [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/saving-changes/git-stash) for a good explanation.

## Git tag

In Git, a tag is a kind of label that points to a specific commit. You can think of it as a branch that doesn't get updated. Once you have tagged a commit, then the tag will stay with that commit.

Tags are often used for tracking versions. Eg a specific commit can be tagged as `v1.3.2`.

## Undoing changes 

Sometimes you will want to unstage a file, undo a commit, remove an ignored file or similar. 

Read [this](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/undoing-changes) to get an idea of some of what you can do.
