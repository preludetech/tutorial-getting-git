# Using Git from the command line 

There are many ways to use Git. A lot of people like to use graphical tools such as GitKraken or SourceTree, but it's very useful to start off by learning how to use Git from the command line. 

## What is the command line?

A command-line, or command line interface, is a kind of user interface for a computer. Usually people interact with a computer by using a keyboard and mouse and a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

A command-line interface lets you interact with your computer purely using text.

In the beginning, using the command-line might feel difficult and unintuitive. Once you get used to it, it'll give you a lot of control and speed. 

## Why learn Git from the command line

A lot of people try to avoid learning Git from the command line because it feels strange, but it's very worthwhile. If you learn to use Git from the command line then your skills will be flexible, portable and robust.

Here are some details of the benefits:

### 1. Master the Fundamentals

Graphical Git clients often simplify complex tasks, but they can also hide what’s happening under the hood. 

By using Git from the command line, you gain a deeper understanding of how Git works — what each command does, and how Git tracks and manages changes. This foundational knowledge makes it easier to debug issues and use advanced Git features effectively, even if you later use a GUI.

If something goes wrong knowing the command line makes it far less intimidating. You can fix it with confidence because you understand Git's internal mechanics.

### 2. Work Anywhere, Anytime

The command line is universal — it works in any environment where Git is installed. Whether you're SSHing into a server, working in a minimalist coding environment, or collaborating on a project without access to a GUI tool, the command line has you covered.

Imagine you're debugging an issue on a remote server. There’s no GUI, and you need to investigate code history or switch branches. Command-line Git is your lifeline.

### 3. Access to Full Git Features

Many Git GUIs only expose a subset of Git's powerful features. The command line gives you access to the full range of Git commands and options, enabling you to handle edge cases, optimize workflows, and execute complex operations that GUIs might oversimplify or omit entirely.

### 4. Speed and Efficiency

For many developers, the command line is faster than clicking through menus in a graphical interface. Once you’re comfortable, typing `git status`, `git commit -m "Fix bug"`, or `git push origin main` becomes second nature and can save time, especially for routine tasks.

Instead of navigating multiple tabs to merge a branch in a GUI, you can accomplish the same in seconds with `git merge`.

### 5. Industry Expectations

Command-line Git is the standard in the industry. Many tutorials, documentation, and troubleshooting guides assume you’re working from the command line. By learning it, you’ll be better prepared to follow instructions, contribute to open-source projects, and collaborate with teams.

Example: Open-source contributions often involve using Git from the command line to fork repositories, clone them locally, create branches, and submit pull requests.

### 6. Build Confidence and Adaptability

When you understand Git at the command-line level, you're less dependent on tools or interfaces. This independence builds confidence and makes it easier to adapt to new workflows or troubleshoot unfamiliar situations.

Example: If your GUI crashes or behaves unexpectedly, you can still commit, merge, or reset using the command line, ensuring your workflow continues uninterrupted.

### 7. Learn Once, Use Everywhere

Once you learn the Git commands, they’re the same across operating systems and tools. GUIs, on the other hand, vary widely, and switching between them often requires relearning how to perform basic tasks.

Example: Whether you’re on macOS, Linux, or Windows, `git clone https://repository.git` works exactly the same.

### 8. Empower Collaboration

When working with teams, you’ll often encounter specific workflows, scripts, or automation that rely on command-line Git. Understanding these commands allows you to integrate seamlessly into team processes.

Example: Continuous integration pipelines frequently execute Git commands to pull code, tag versions, or manage branches. Knowing these commands helps you understand and even debug those systems.
